üèÜ What This Means for Your ComplianceChecker

  To be state-of-the-art, your Ask AI feature should include:

  1. Document Chat Interface - Users can ask natural language questions
  about uploaded docs
  2. Contextual Analysis - AI understands the compliance framework being
  used
  3. Gap Detection - Automatically identifies missing requirements
  4. Smart Recommendations - Suggests specific improvements with evidence
  5. Multi-Framework Support - Handles different compliance standards
  6. Privacy-First - Option for local AI deployment

  Example state-of-the-art interactions:
  - "What security controls are missing from our authentication policy?"
  - "Compare our access control documentation to SOC 2 requirements"
  - "Generate remediation steps for critical compliance gaps"
  - "Explain why requirement XYZ failed and suggest fixes"

  Would you like me to implement a modern AI chat interface that
  incorporates these state-of-the-art capabilities?
